    "text": "To accelerate efforts to reduce health care disparities, hospitals and health systems increase their efforts in core areas such as staff and leadership diversity and cultural competence. However, the economic relationship between healthcare systems and the communities they serve are growing in importance.\nSupplier diversity refers to when an organization procures goods and services from a variety of businesses, including those that are at least 51% owned, managed, and operated from marginalized and minority groups. These include women, veterans, African Americans, LGBTQIA+, and more. The private sector, including the healthcare industry has incorporated supplier diversity programs into their business practices after historically being adopted by the federal government and its contractors. According to the Harvard Business Review, supplier diversity programs are important in combatting social injustice and systemic racism in the US as they actively include diverse representation and inclusion in hospital operations and supply chains. In addition, for the moral and ethical arguments, supplier diversity programs have commercial in hospitals and health systems. These benefits include greater innovation and value through cost reductions, expansions of external partnerships, local job creation, better understanding of supply chain sourcing process and sources, and easier compliance with government and grant contracts.\nOn an annual basis (individual hospital fiscal year), individual hospitals and systems report detailed facility level financial data to the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI). This data includes detailed facility level data on services capacity, inpatient/outpatient utilization, revenues, and expenses by type and payer. In addition, the Health and Safety Code Section 1339.85-1339.87 requires individual hospitals with operating expenses over $50 million to report hospital supplier and diversity reports explaining the hospitals’ supplier diversity statement and procurement efforts regarding minority, women, LGBT, and disabled veteran enterprises. Each hospital also reports tier 1 and tier 2 spend for each category of diverse suppliers. Tier 1 spend refers to the total amount of procurement dollars that an organization spends directly with a certified diverse supplier. Tier 2, on the other hand represents the total amount of procurement dollars that an organization spends with a given supplier, who then sources products and services from another certified diverse supplier. Tier 2 relationships enable hospitals to increase diversity spend while working with existing suppliers or with suppliers who may possess rare capabilities.\nMedi-Cal eligible patients are also a significant portion of the population in California, making up a large portion of the state’s healthcare system. The HCAI’s financial report also reveals the revenue generated by hospitals from Medi-Cal patients, offering valuable insights into the economic pressures that hospitals face while serving this demographic. As the hospitals system increasingly rely on reimbursements from Medi-Cal, it is important to examine how hospitals’ procurement practices might influence their financial performance, including revenue from Medi-Cal patients.\nThis report merges the annual financial data and supplier diversity reports for 2023 to answer the question Are California hospitals with diverse suppliers profitable? Supplier diversity aims to increase innovation and drive down prices for supplies and goods though competition while also aiming to improve health equity and combat social injustice in the US through business practices. This exploratory data analysis aims to see if funds dedicated to goods and services from diversely owned businesses can lead to better financial outcomes."

    "text": "What about Medi-Cal Revenue?\nMedi-Cal revenue is an important factor to consider when looking at procurement from diverse suppliers because hospitals that serve a higher proportion of Medi-Cal patients may face different financial pressures compared to those with a more commercially insured patient base. The correlation analysis shows that the relationships between diverse supplier procurement and Medi-Cal revenue are mostly weak and negative for several minority groups, indicating limited impact or a lack of strong association. However, procurement from diverse suppliers can still be a strategy to fulfill diversity and inclusion goals, potentially improve cost efficiency, foster local engagement, and ensure compliance with government contracts, which may influence financial outcomes and help advance community health equity objectives.
